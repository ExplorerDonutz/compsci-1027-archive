3. After multiplying the return value by -1 in compareByName(), how are the names being sorted? Why is this happening?
They are being sorted in reverse order because the negatives and positives have been swapped (greatest is now least)


EXERCISE 3

4. Why is the list of cities being shown in this order initially?
They are ordered in population from lowest to highest


5.
a) Initially, does the order in which the cities are added to the list affect the order in which they are stored in the list?
No because it is comparing their populations as they are added


b) After completing compareTo(), does the order in which the cities are added to the list affect the order in which they are stored in the list?
No because they are sorted and moved around according to their comparison
