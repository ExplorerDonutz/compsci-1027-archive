Answers for Lab 7
-----------------------------------------------

EXERCISE 1

1. Which methods in the LinkedQueue class are taking in a parameter of the generic type T?
enqueue()


2. Which methods in the LinkedQueue class have a return type of the generic type T?
dequeue() and first()


3. Suppose you didn't have an instance variable storing the current number of elements in the queue. How could you determine the number of elements for the size() method if such an instance variable was not available?
Loop through the queue


EXERCISE 2

4. Consider the possibility of using an Array Queue or a Circular Array Queue instead of the Linked Queue being used in this simulation. Would the simulation's results be impacted by switching to a different Queue implementation?
The result wouldn't change, but the code would be different


5. Which of these classes/methods would you have to modify if you were going to use one of the other queue implementations?
Nothing, the LinkedQueue does the work, not the snail class


EXERCISE 3

6. What was the error message when you tried to load the next image after the image of musicians? Why is it crashing?
EmptyCollectionException, it's crashing because there is no more images in the queue


7. When you try performing the "undo" operation (before modifying the code in GraphicSystem.java), does it work as expected? Why or why not?
Nothing happens, there is no undo operations saved
